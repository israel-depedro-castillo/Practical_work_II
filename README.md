# Problems that i had

22/12/2025

- I had problems finding the right css style, so i had to look the ones that are more suitable for a page,and ask the Ai for advice in the matter, since im not really good at decorating web pages.
- How to make a image take you to another page with a link, had to look at stack overflow https://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/536593/como-poner-un-link-en-una-imagen-para-que-me-lleven-a-una-imagen

23/12/2025

- Trying to do the about.html page i encountered in the file that was given to us by the teacher, the section part, i didnt know fully how to do it so i looked it up at the following page to help me understand it:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/section (after looking at it it seemed pretty similar to using a div, but i found out that section is normally used when you want to put the main information about the topic.).

- No problems to report

27/12/2025

- Had trouble to select the topic for the topic-html file, so i had to revisit my thoughts and finally decided to do it about a topic that fascinates me, in this case kubernetes.

28/12/2025
Had a problem uploding the page to github, i was using the , root folder instead of the public folder which tooke me some time until i looked it up and the activity III that we did for FCE.
Had problems in fce.html with the nav links, with led me to not reirecting my to the correct page.

# Conclusions:

In this case this is a fully funtional web, that atleast has the requirements that were nedded to complete the work, that means that theres always room for improvement, in this case with the css, but this is a software work so i prioritized web funcionality to web design. For the most part the web was easy to do thanks to previous knowledge, and to the pdf that were given to us by the ufv and teacher Moisés Martínez Muñoz.
