# Problems that i had

22/12/2025

- I had problems finding the right css style, so i had to look the ones that i like,and ask the Ai for advice in the matter, since im not really good at decorating web pages.
- How to make a image take you to another page with a link, had to look at stack overflow https://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/536593/como-poner-un-link-en-una-imagen-para-que-me-lleven-a-una-imagen

23/12/2025

- Trying to do the about.html page i encountered in the file that was given to us by the teacher, the section part, i didnt know fully how to do it so i looked it up at the following page to help me understand it:
  https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/section (after looking at it it seemed pretty similar to using a div, but i found out that section is normally used when you want to put the main information about the topic.).
